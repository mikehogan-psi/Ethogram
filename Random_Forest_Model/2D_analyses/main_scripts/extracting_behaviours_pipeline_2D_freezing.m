%% Behavioural Analysis Pipeline to define an predict specific behaviours (for 2D data)

% This analysis pipeline allows for the identification (a.k.a. extraction) of desired mouse behaviours ("target behaviour")

% input: DLC (Deep lab cut) labeled data - raw x and y coordinates of body markers
% end-outout: frames in which desired behaviour is exhibited

% Individual analysis steps:
%            Step 0: General SETUP                                  - define directories, model names and general variables
%            STEP 1: Generate Statistical Shape model (SSM)         - using 2D-upper function to correct outliers and generate mean pose & eigenposes
%            STEP 2: Generate Statistical Shape model fitted data   - uses SSM to calculate mouse body shape parameter measures 
%            STEP 3: SETUP calculate features function              - define which features (derived from  body shape parameters) and time window shall be used to train model to predict behaviour
%            STEP 4: Manually label frames of 3-4 videos            - label frames that exibit desried behaviour (to later train model with)
%            STEP 5: Train Random Forest Model                      - associates the previously defined features with behaviour
%            STEP 6: predict labels in full dataset                 - trained model to predict behaviour in each frame based on exhibited features
%            STEP 7: Post-processing                                - Remove small groups of false positive labels
%            STEP 8: Manual check predicted label accuracy and correct labels  
%            STEP 9: Asessment of model senstivity                  - manual check of predcited labels for estimation of model accuracy and sensitivity     



% Behaviour definitions (for concistency the behaviours were consequently defined if at least one of the points was fullfilled)
    % rearing and exploratory behaviour (non-anxiety):
    %   - standing on hind legs
    %   - looking up
    %   - front paws touching side of arena AND looking up
    %   - average timewindow = 30s

    % darting behaviour (anxiety):
    %   - short, quick bursts of running and/or abrupt changes in direction
    %   - freezing before and after darting
    %   - running into courner of box 
    %   - average timewindow = 30s


%% Step 0: General SETUP 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % !!! CHANGE/ ADJUST THESE AS NECCECSARY !!!%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 1. Define variables that remain concistent throughout entire analyses

     % A: mouse part that shall be analysied (depends on behaviour that will be investigated)
            which_part = 'body';    % for behaviours that entail changes in body posture e.g. rearing
            % which_part = 'tail';  % for behaviours that entail changes in tail movements e.g. tail rattling 

     % B: define target behaviour that shall be analysed
            behaviour = 'freezing';  

     % C: define which name generated models shall be given
            SSM_model_name = ['SSM_mouse1_30' which_part];      % Can be left out if SSM fitted data already generated
            RFM_model_name = ['RFM_' behaviour '_1'];      % this model will be used to predict behaviour -> folders in which behavioral data is stored is named after the model
                                                                % !!! make a note of all the configurations used for this model (see Random forest model configurations document)                                                                
                             
                                                                
% 2. Define directories to where specific data can be accessed/saved 
     % A: folder containing 'raw' data from all mice (data before any behaviours predicted)  
            % common_raw_dir = 'C:\Abi_Hogan\behavioral_analysis\data_all_mice\'; % Stopford PC
            common_raw_dir = 'C:\Users\Abi Hogan\Documents\Psychedelics_Internship\behavior_analysis\data_all_mice'; % Laptop

     % subdirectories containing video and DLC data (must be already defined) + folder where SSM fitted data shall be saved 
            % ! make sure these folders already exist and contain correct data prior to starting analysis !
            video_path    = [common_raw_dir '\video_data\video_data_extinction\'];               % raw video data (videos of mice) 
            DLC_data_path = [common_raw_dir '\DLC_data\DLC_extinction_Data'];                    % DLC data(coordinates of body label markers generated by DeepLabCut 
            SSM_data_path = [common_raw_dir '\SSM_fitted_data\SSM_fitted_data_extinction\'];     % SSM fitted data (2D-Upper generated data - corrected body marker positions and mean/eigenpose data)
      
     % B: folder where data labeled with desired behaviour shall be saved   
            % common_behav_dir = 'C:\Abi_Hogan\behavioral_analysis\extinction_analysis\rearing_data\';  % Stopford PC
              common_behav_dir = 'C:\Users\Abi Hogan\Documents\Psychedelics_Internship\behavior_analysis\extinction_analysis'; % Laptop


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% % ! will be automatically created for each new analyses (based on the previous definitions !%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 % 1. subdirectories containing behaviour labeled data 
    
        manual_labels_path    = [common_behav_dir '\' behaviour '_analyses\' RFM_model_name '\manually_labeled_data\'];   % data with frames manually labeled as behaviour (to train model)
                                 mkdir(manual_labels_path);
        predicted_labels_path = [common_behav_dir '\' behaviour '_analyses\' RFM_model_name '\predicted_labels_data\'];   % data with behaviour labels predicted by model
                                 mkdir(predicted_labels_path);
        corrected_labels_path = [common_behav_dir '\' behaviour '_analyses\' RFM_model_name '\corrected_labeled_data\'];   % predcited_labvelds data which was manually corrected

                                 addpath(genpath([common_behav_dir '\' behaviour '_analyses\' RFM_model_name ])); % adds new model folder and subfolders to matlab path

 % 2. Define directories to where models shall be saved (both the SSM and RFM will be saved here)
        model_path =  [common_behav_dir '\models\']; 
                       mkdir(model_path);
            SSM_model_name_path = [model_path SSM_model_name]; % automatically defines path to find SSM model
            RFM_model_name_path = [model_path RFM_model_name]; % automatically defines path to find SSM model


 % 3. Extract DLC data files and count them 
        all_DLC_files = dir(fullfile(DLC_data_path, '*mouse*')); % makes a struct containing details of all DLC files 
        num_files = length(all_DLC_files);                   % identifies number of files (for each mouse two files so 2x nr. of mice)

%% STEP 1: Generate Statistical Shape model (SSM) - skip if SSM fitted data already generated
% here the DLC data is used to generate a SSM of the mouse using the 2D_upper analysis pipeline
% performs following operations: 1.removes outliers
%                                2.performs data alignment (computes mean pose i.e. average shape of mouse)
%                                3.applies PCA to model shape variation (computes eigenposes which represent the primary modes of variation from the mean pose)

% run function that will estimate SSM for moude body or tail 
Estimate_SSM_final(which_part, all_DLC_files, SSM_model_name_path)

% SSM_mouse1_30body: results of PCA  (the tree main eigenposes that together explain 93.2% of the data variation from mean pose)
                    % Eigenpose 1: "elongation/hunching" of body (explains 48.8% of variation)
                    % Eigenpose 2: "bending side to side" of body
                    % Eigenpose 3: "up/down movement" of head

%% STEP 2: Generate Statistical Shape model fitted data (using 2D-Upper trained model) - skip if SSM fitted data already generated

% the SSM is used to generate mouse body shape parameter measures for every single frame:
%     A(Rotation Angle)        - rotational alignment of the fitted Statistical Shape Model (SSM) with the observed data for each frame 
%     b(Shape Coefficients)    - These are the weights for the eigenvectors in the shape model, describe how much each principal component contributes to the reconstructed shape.
%     C(Cost Function Value)   - Measures the fit quality of the model to the observed data
%     missing(Missing Data)    - A logical flag indicating whether the frame has insufficient valid data points (e.g., due to outliers or missing observations)
%     T(Translation Vector)    - The 2D translation vector that aligns the fitted model to the observed data, describes the offset in x and y directions.
%     X(Input Coordinates)     - The original input coordinates after removing outliers and applying the necessary filters (body or tail). 
%     Xfit(Fitted Coordinates) - The reconstructed 2D coordinates of the shape after fitting the Statistical Shape Model. Represents the closest match to the observed data.

    cd(DLC_data_path) % Enter folder that contains all DLC data files    

% run SSM on all files to generate body shape parameters
z
for i = 1:num_files
    
    filename = all_DLC_files(i).name;

    Fit_SSM(filename, which_part, SSM_data_path, SSM_model_name_path);

end

%% STEP 3: SETUP calculate features function
 
%%%%%%%%%%%!!! DEFINE VARIABLES TO CALCULATE RELEVANT FEATURES !!!%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 1. out of the following list of all possible to calculate features decide which onces are relevant for the target behaviour

  'mean(diff(b_window(3, :)))';                    % Feature 9:  Trend of change in "looking up/down" posture (rate and  direction of vertical motion dynamism)
  'mean([0, sqrt(sum(diff(T_window, 1, 2).^2))])'; % Feature 10: Average velocity (overall movement intensity)
  'mean([0, abs(diff(A_window))])'                 % Feature 11: Average Angular Velocity / Average change in orientation (Describes rotational movement)

 };

% 2. define which features are relevant for the target behaviour

%% STEP 8: Manual check predicted label accuracy and correct labels  

% choose a file you want to double-check the mouse behaviour of the frames predicted by the model to show the desired behaviour 
base_name = 'mouse19_extinction_p1';

    % Find the correct video and predicted labels file
    video_file_path = dir(fullfile(video_path, [base_name, '*.avi']));
    video_file_path = [video_path video_file_path.name];
    predicted_file_path = dir(fullfile(predicted_labels_path, ['predicted_' behaviour '_labels_', base_name, '*.mat']));
    predicted_file_path = [predicted_labels_path predicted_file_path.name];
    
    % fun validate predcitions function
         validate_predictions(video_file_path, predicted_file_path, corrected_labels_path);
         % should open video in which can manually scrub through frames and see if the predicted labels match actual behaviour and if necessary correct it
    
    % repeat this for a couple of videos to generate enough verified_labels data to update model (to increase its accuracy)     

%% STEP 9: Assess model accuracy and sensitivity 

% choose a video which you have the manual or verified labels and predicted labels for 
base_name = 'mouse2_extinction_p2';

    % load the correct label variable (either from manually labelled or corrected label files)
    matFiles = dir(fullfile(corrected_labels_path, [base_name, '*.mat']));

            if isempty(matFiles)
               matFiles = dir(fullfile(manual_labels_path, [base_name, '*.mat']));
               load([manual_labels_path, matFiles.name]);
               correct_labels = all_frames_labels;  
    
            else     
                load([corrected_labels_path, matFiles.name]);  
                correct_labels = verified_labels; 
            end
    
   % load the by model predicted label variable      
   matFiles = dir(fullfile(predicted_labels_path, ['predicted_' behaviour '_labels_', base_name, '*.mat']));
              load([predicted_labels_path matFiles.name]);  

    % Calculate accuracy
    accuracy_score = sum(predicted_labels == correct_labels) / length(predicted_labels);
    
    % Calculate d-prime
    hit_rate = sum(predicted_labels == 1 & correct_labels == 1) / sum(correct_labels == 1);
    false_alarm_rate = sum(predicted_labels == 1 & correct_labels == 0) / sum(correct_labels == 0);
    
    % Prevent extreme hit/false alarm rates (avoid infinity in z-score)
    hit_rate = max(min(hit_rate, 0.99), 0.01);
    false_alarm_rate = max(min(false_alarm_rate, 0.99), 0.01);
    
    % Compute d-prime
    d_prime_score = (norminv(hit_rate) - norminv(false_alarm_rate)) / sqrt(2);
    
    disp([base_name ' ' behaviour ' predictions:']);
    disp(['Accuracy = ', num2str(accuracy_score * 100), '%']);
